        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
          <p> A fairly soft-spoken person who also likes a fun time with friends, is thoughtful and introspective
            and wants the challenge of a career that combines technical knowledge with creativity and 
            meaningful impact. I'm one to use my faculities to garner trust and unity within a group
            in order to produce quality work as well as a good crew relationship.
